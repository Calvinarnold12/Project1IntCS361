OVERVIEW:
Concisely explain what the program does. If this exceeds a couple
of sentences, you're going too far. The details go in other
sections.
INCLUDED FILES:
List the files required for the project with a brief
explanation of why each is included.
e.g.
* Class1.java - source file
* Class2.java - source file
* README - this file
COMPILING AND RUNNING:
Give the command for compiling the program, the command
for running the program, and any usage instructions the
user needs.
These are command-line instructions for a system like onyx.
They have nothing to do with Eclipse or any other IDE. They
must be specific - assume the user has Java installed, but
has no idea how to compile or run a Java program from the
command-line.
e.g.
From the directory containing all source files, compile the
driver class (and all dependencies) with the command:
$ javac Class1.java
Run the compiled class file with the command:
$ java Class1
Console output will give the results after the program finishes.
PROGRAM DESIGN AND IMPORTANT CONCEPTS:
This is the sort of information someone who really wants to
understand your program - possibly to make future enhancements -
would want to know.
Explain the main concepts and organization of your program so that
the reader can understand how your program works. This is not a repeat
of javadoc comments or an exhaustive listing of all methods, but an
explanation of the critical algorithms and object interactions that make
up the program.
Explain the main responsibilities of the classes and interfaces that make
up the program. Explain how the classes work together to achieve the
program
goals. If there are critical algorithms that a user should understand,
explain them as well.
If you were responsible for designing the program's classes and choosing
how they work together, why did you design the program this way? What, if
anything, could be improved?
TESTING:
How did you test your program to be sure it works and meets all of the
requirements? What was the testing strategy? What kinds of tests were
run?
Can your program handle bad input? Is your program idiot-proof? How do
you
know? What are the known issues / bugs remaining in your program?
DISCUSSION:
-Calvin: The most challenging part for this assignment for me was visualizing 
the interactions of the hashmaps/hashsets in such a manner that I was not mixing
them up in my head. Specifically,  the delta map was causing me grief when 
implementing the transitions function. I kept losing my mental image when
thinking about where key values were being mapped when testing. Eventually, 
I just decided to write it down, and that helped.  
What parts of the project did you find challenging? Is there anything
that finally "clicked" for you in the process of working on this project?
EXTRA CREDIT:
If the project had opportunities for extra credit that you attempted,
be sure to call it out so the grader does not overlook it.
SOURCES:
All sources used outside of lecture notes, slides, and the textbook need
to
be cited here. If you used websites, used GenAI, asked your dad or your
boss
or your roommate for help then you must cite those resources. I am not
concerned if you use proper APA or MLA or another format as long as you
include
all relevant information. If it is a person or GenAI that you referenced,
be
sure to include who you talked to (or which AI you accessed), when you
talked
to them, and what help they provided (e.g. Student, Awesome. Private
communication, 21 January 2026. Discussed how polymorphism allows the
return
types of methods implemented in a class to be different from the class
specified
in the interface as long as the <type in implementation> “is-a” <type in
interface>.)

All content in a README file is expected to be written in clear English
with
proper grammar, spelling, and punctuation. If you are not a strong writer,
be sure to get someone else to help you with proofreading. Consider all
project
documentation to be professional writing for your boss and/or potential
customers.
